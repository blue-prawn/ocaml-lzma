==== Description ====

Lzma provides very high compression ratio and fast decompression:

- Average compression ratio 30% better than that of gzip and 15%
  better than that of bzip2.

- Decompression speed is only little slower than that of gzip, being
  two to five times faster than bzip2.

- In fast mode, compresses faster than bzip2 with a comparable
  compression ratio.

- Achieving the best compression ratios takes four to even twelve
  times longer than with bzip2. However, this doesn't affect
  decompressing speed.
